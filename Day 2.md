**Start of Day2**

**Arbeitsaufteilung**
- Since we have have started to develope a Game that needs *Teams* to function, we decided that **Jann** is doing everything related to Unity and Coding since he has more knowledge in that Part then **Janis**.
- **Janis** will take care of any GitHub Related work. For Example Creating new Markdowns, Issues, Roadmaps etc.

**Special Work**
- If were gonna get Feedback regarding Map / Enviroment, Speed, Steering, Stability or Replayabilty, both of us will be taking part in those *Events*. Since both of us need the Feedback to continue working on our Game.
