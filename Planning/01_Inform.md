# 1. **Inform (Day 1)**

## First things first

First we thinked about a Topic we could choose that is a Project but is also IT Related. After some talking we settled on the Topic of making a Game.
After all that we Brainstormed about what the game should be... Should it be a 2D Game or a 3D Game.
What kind of Game should it be? Should it be a JnR Game (Jump and Run), A shooting Game or a Racing / Car Game <-- Thats what we choose.
