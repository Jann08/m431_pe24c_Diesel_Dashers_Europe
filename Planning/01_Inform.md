# Inform – Diesel Dash Europe

## 1. Gathering Ideas
*Diesel Dash Europe* started because I love trucks and driving games. My goal is to make a **realistic truck simulation** with features like **changing gears, fuel use, and performance tuning**. I chose Unity to develop it because I have experience with it and there are many helpful resources.

## 2. Information Needed
To make the game, I had to gather different kinds of information:

### 📅 Dates & Timing
- Schedule for development, important milestones, and deadlines.
- Expected date for submission and presentation details.

### 📦 What to Deliver
- A **working version** of the game.
- **Documentation** of features that are completed.
- A **GitHub repository** with the source code.

### 📚 Knowledge to Gain
- **Game Development**: Learning about Unity’s physics and scripting with C#.
- **Truck Simulation**: Researching how real trucks work.
- **Optimization Methods**: Learning techniques like **Occlusion Culling** and **LOD** to improve performance.

### 🛠 Tools I Used
- 🎮 **Unity** (the game engine)
- 💻 **Visual Studio 2022** (for coding and fixing issues)
- 🎨 **Paint.net** (for textures and UI design)
- 🐙 **GitHub Desktop** (for version control)
- 📸 **ShareX** (for taking screenshots and documentation)

## 3. Finding Inspiration

### 🎮 Games for Ideas
Several truck simulators and racing games inspired me:

- **Euro Truck Simulator 2** – Realistic truck handling.
- **SnowRunner** – Detailed terrain physics.
- **BeamNG.drive** – Realistic driving mechanics.

### 🔎 Research & Development
To create *Diesel Dash Europe*, I concentrated on:

- A **realistic gear system** with multiple speeds.
- A **fuel system** that decreases and can be refilled at gas stations.
- An **optimized display** using **Occlusion Culling** and **LOD** for better performance.

## 4. Game Requirements
I categorized the requirements into **functional** and **non-functional**:

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- The truck must have a **working gear system**.
- A **speedometer and gear indicator** must show on the screen.
- The truck must **use fuel** based on distance and speed.
- **Gas stations should allow refueling**.
- The game must run **smoothly** and be optimized.

### ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
- The game must feel **realistic and immersive**.
- Performance should stay **above 60 FPS** on average computers.
- The UI should be **simple but informative**.

## 5. Tools Used

### 🎮 Unity
Unity is the game engine for *Diesel Dash Europe*. It provides tools for **physics simulation, user interface, and coding**, making it easy to add more features in the future.

### 💻 Visual Studio 2022
- Used for **writing C# scripts** to control truck movement, the UI, and interactions.
- Helpful for debugging and testing in Unity.

### 🎨 Paint.net
- Used to create **textures, UI elements, and designs**.
- Helps give the truck and environment a **unique look**.

### 🐙 GitHub Desktop
- Used for **tracking changes and managing the project**.
- Ensures all updates are saved and easy to revert if needed.

### 📸 Printscreen
- Used to **take screenshots and document progress**.
- Useful for making **visual documentation**.

## 6. Glossary

- **LOD** = Level of Detail (making distant objects less detailed for better performance).
- **FPS** = Frames Per Second (how well the game performs).
- **Occlusion Culling** = Only showing objects that the player can see.
- **NPC** = Non-Playable Character (not used yet but might be added later).

## 7. Sources
No outside references were needed because most information came from **my own knowledge** and practical experience with Unity and game development.
