# 💡 IPERKA – Realize Mapping
 
To build the game, I worked step by step in Unity. First, I created a new 3D project and opened it.
 
## 1. Terrain creation and shaping  
I added a terrain to the scene and used different brushes to shape the landscape. I made hills and flat areas where roads and buildings could go.
 
## 2. Painting the terrain  
I used a free asset with many grass textures to paint the terrain. This made everything look more realistic and nicer.

## 3. Adding trees  
I used Unity’s built-in tree placement tool to quickly place many trees. I used a tree pack from the Asset Store.  
**Asset:** [Realistic Tree Pack Vol. 1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/realistic-tree-pack-vol-1-50418)
 
## 4. Creating roads  
With the “EasyRoads” tool, I was able to draw roads directly in the scene. The tool also changed the terrain to fit the roads.

## 5. Building the gas station  
I used small models from a countryside gas station asset to build a realistic fuel station.
