# Decide
## How we made decisions
* Since we are doing this project as a team of two, We are able to discuss our decisions togehter.

## Decision log
* Decision: Using Unity over other Programms like Unreal Engine or "Scratch"
  * Reaso.: We are using Unity because Jann already has some kind of experience in Unity so its abit easier for us

* Decision: Having a Truck as a Vehicle over a Car
  * Reason: We felt like that every Game that has a Vehicle is mostly a Car game so we wanted to switch things up
  * Date: 04.03.2025

* Decision: Having good Physics
  * Reason: We wanted that our Game feels authentic to reallife in a small Way so we added a bit of Suspension physics
