# Basic Features of our Game

‚úÖ **Vehicle Control:** A truck that can be driven using a keyboard or controller.  
‚úÖ **Physics & Driving Behavior:** Realistic acceleration, braking, and turning.  
‚úÖ **Delivery Missions:** Players pick up cargo and deliver it to the destination.  
‚úÖ **Minimap/GPS:** A small map displaying the route.  
‚úÖ **Time/Point System:** The faster and more precise the delivery, the more points/money.  

## Extensions (If Time Allows)

üöõ **Gas Stations & Repair Shops:** The truck needs regular refueling and maintenance.  
üå¶Ô∏è **Weather & Day/Night Cycle:** Dynamic environment for more realism.  
üèôÔ∏è **Large Road Network:** Various routes with highways, country roads, etc.  
üöß **Challenges:** Traffic jams, breakdowns, and construction sites as obstacles.  

# IPERKA Structure for the 10-Day Plan

## 1. **Inform (Day 1)**
- Introduction to Unity & C#  
- Research on vehicle physics in Unity  
- Creation of a rough game design document  

## 2. **Plan (Day 2)**
- Task distribution within the team  
- Creation of a prioritized to-do list  
- Setting up the basic scene structure in Unity  

## 3. **Decide (Day 3-4)**
- Selection of the truck control method (keyboard/controller)  
- Implementation of Rigidbody physics for realistic driving behavior  
- Initial testing of driving behavior and collisions  

## 4. **Implement (Day 5-6)**
- Development of delivery missions and checkpoints  
- Programming mission logic (starting point, destination, time limit)  
- Conducting initial test drives  

## 5. **Control (Day 7-8)**
- Implementation of a minimap & UI elements for missions  
- Functional testing of all features so far  
- Adjusting vehicle physics and game balance  

## 6. **Evaluate (Day 9-10)**
- Debugging & optimization  
- Final adjustments to UI & gameplay  
- Presentation & test runs with other players
