# Basic Features of our Game

‚úÖ **Vehicle Control:** A truck that can be driven using a keyboard or controller.  
‚úÖ **Physics & Driving Behavior:** Realistic acceleration, braking, and turning.  
‚úÖ **Delivery Missions:** Players pick up cargo and deliver it to the destination.  
‚úÖ **Time/Point System:** The faster and more precise the delivery, the more points/money.  

## Extensions (If Time Allows)

üöõ **Gas Stations The truck needs regular refueling.  
üå¶Ô∏è **Weather & Day/Night Cycle:** Dynamic environment for more realism.  
üèôÔ∏è **Large Road Network:** Various routes with highways, country roads, etc.  
üöß **Challenges:** Traffic jams, breakdowns, and construction sites as obstacles.

- Final presentation showcasing the game‚Äôs development, features, and gameplay.  

## 2. When?
- **Start:** [Insert Start Date]  
- **Stop:** [Insert Deadline or Completion Date]  

## 3. Why? (Context)
- This project is part of a school assignment, requiring the development of a functional 3D game in Unity.  
- The documentation ensures structured planning, execution, and evaluation of the project.  
- The presentation serves to showcase the final product, highlight challenges, and demonstrate learning progress.  

## 4. How? (Requirements)
- Use the **IPERKA method** to structure the documentation.  
- Include milestones, development process, challenges, and solutions.  
- Demonstrate Unity implementation, truck physics, UI design, and mission logic.  
- Present a **working prototype** of *Diesel Dash Europe* in the final presentation.  
- Address potential issues and how they were resolved.  

## 5. Who?

## üöõ Core Gameplay Loop  

### üì¶ Accepting Delivery Missions  
- Players start at a **truck depot** or **warehouse**.  
- A **job menue** displays available delivery missions with details like:  
  - **Destination** (City, countryside, or industrial zone).  
- After selecting a job, players must **attach the cargo trailer** before hitting the road.   

### üèÅ Completing the Delivery  
- Players must carefully **park and unload cargo** at the destination.  
- Rewards based on **delivery time, cargo condition, and efficiency**.  
- Earned money can be used to:  
  - Upgrade the truck (engine, tires, fuel capacity).  
  - Customize the truck (paint, lights, exhausts).  
  - Unlock new **regions and longer routes**.  

## üöÄ Additional Features (If Time Allows)  
- **Economy System**: Buy new trucks, take higher-paying jobs, or even start a trucking company.
- **Cargo type** (Fragile goods, fuel, heavy machinery, etc.).
